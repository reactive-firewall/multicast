## Excluded Licenses, not included with package

### Third-Party Dependencies

Multicast project testing code is under an MIT license like the Multicast module; however
the project's Testing can use tools which are split between multiple licenses (but may not be
bundled). While all of the source code is open-source, using some of the project testing is only
possible in an environment where additional restrictions apply, due to third-party licensing which
is incompatible if it were to be included with the rest of the project as a whole.

### Files: `requirements.txt`, `docs/requirements.txt`, `tests/requirements.txt`

***
Certain Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools may require GNU licensed
software to operate effectively.
Environment Compatibility: Users must ensure that their testing environments are equipped
with the necessary components and licenses to run the testing code. This is akin to a
"batteries not included" disclaimer, indicating that additional setup may be required.

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable licenses and for setting up
their environments accordingly.

The individual dependencies are owned by their respective copyright holders.
_NO ASSOCIATION._
