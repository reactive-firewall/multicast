# ### Security Advisory: Command Injection Risk in `tests/check_pip`
#
# When using the `tests/check_pip` script, be aware of a potential command injection vulnerability arising from module names containing special characters or leading hyphens (e.g., `-v`). The script has been updated to properly handle such module names by:
#
# - Using `--` in `grep` commands to prevent interpreting module names as options.
# - Ensuring all inputs are correctly sanitized and special characters are handled safely.
#
# **Recommendations for Developers:**
#
# - **Validation:** Always ensure that variables used in shell commands are properly handled to avoid being misinterpreted as options or commands.
# - **Updates:** Pull the latest changes from the repository to incorporate the security fixes in `tests/check_pip`.
# - **Testing:** Incorporate static code analysis tools to detect similar vulnerabilities in the future.
